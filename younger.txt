Hey what's up guys! I'm super stoked to be going to Coachella this year. I've been wanting to go for ages, but it's always been sold out. Luckily, I was able to score some tickets from a friend of a friend. The lineup is sick, with artists like Posty, Travis, and Billie. I'm definitely gonna be lit af the whole weekend. I'm thinking of going with my squad, but I'm still waiting to hear back from them. I don't wanna have FOMO , so I'm low-key planning on going solo if they don't come through. Anyway, I gotta go finish packing. Catch you guys on the flip side!
